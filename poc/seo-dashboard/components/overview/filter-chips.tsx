/** `report.statusHistogram` counts pages ∪ failures (including failures that never became a page
 *  record, e.g. a request blocked after retries) — a broader population than /pages can ever
 *  render, so chips built from it could show a count their own destination can't reproduce.
 *
 *  /pages itself (lib/data-explorer.ts's buildExplorerRows) is its own explorer, not the plain
 *  page list lib/data-pages.ts backs for the JSON API — it renders ONE ROW PER page + ONE ROW PER
 *  failure + ONE ROW PER blocked URL, undeduplicated (a page that failed with a 4xx shows up
 *  twice: once bucketed "4xx" from its page record, once bucketed "failed" from its failure
 *  record). "All pages" (no status filter) must match that same total, not just pages.length —
 *  every status-bucketed chip (2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx) is still `pages`-only and safe, because only a
 *  page record ever gets bucketed into one of those four; failures always bucket "failed" and
 *  blocked URLs always bucket "blocked", so they can never leak into a 2xx–5xx filter's rows. */
