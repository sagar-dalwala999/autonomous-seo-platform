/**
 * Envelope encryption for Google refresh tokens (AES-256-GCM).
 *
 * A refresh token is a long-lived bearer credential to a user's Search
 * Console data — it does not expire on its own and cannot be invalidated from
 * our side. Storing them in plaintext would make a storage-dir leak equivalent
 * to handing over every connected Google account, so they are sealed before
 * they ever reach a file.
 *
 * GCM rather than CBC because it authenticates as well as encrypts: a
 * tampered ciphertext fails to open instead of decrypting to garbage that
 * then gets sent to Google.
